Code built using NodeJs NPM dependency manager. 
Requires NPM and NodeJs on Linux Environment.


1) Start your solr server.

1) Browse to nodeJs folder included in submission using linux/mac term commandline.

2) Edit server.js and change both solr core name,one for index and other for suggestions.

3) Run "npm install"   .this will install all the dependencies(not included in submission due to large file size) from package.json file.

4) Once dependencies are fetched run : "npm start" in the same folder. this should start server at port 3000.

5) Go to broswer of your choice and open localhost:3000, search engine should be running successfully now.
