Hadoop as a Single Clustered Node.

First Things First:

Hadoop has 3 main componenets:
	1)HDFS -Hadoop distributed file systems - open source implementation of GOOGLE FILE SYSTEMS - This is as close as you can get to GFS :D (unless you are a google employee!!)
	2)MapReduce - This is what hadoop revolves around.A framework to define data processing task
	3)Yarn - Yet Another Resource Negotiator.A framework to run the data processing task.
 

Hadoop runs on a Linux environment, so if you are a windows user, install linux on a virtual machine ,use virtual box etc..Plenty of tutorials for this.

Once you are in linux/unix shell. Start terminal and type : java -version to see if you hava java installed ,if installed then you should be having java 8 for this.
If not do type in these commands and you will have Java8

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

Now for hadoop your machine must be able to ssh to itself.

for ssh do this:

sudo apt-get install ssh

For Passkey less authentication , generate and add public key to authorized keys: this step is a must.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -P "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

now if you try : ssh localhost , it should connect to itself without asking for a password.

Now time to download hadoop binary!!
Go to website : http://hadoop.apache.org/releases.html and download latest stable version and make sure you download the binary not the src file.

do this to uncompress:
tar xvf hadoop-filename-whatever.tar.gz
mv hadoop-smthing_that_got_uncompressed where_ever_you_want/hadoop


now add environment variables to bash file(if you use a shell other than bash ,go to that rc file):
sudo nano ~/.bashrc

add these 2 paths at bottom of the file.
export HADOOP_HOME = "path to hadoop folder(you need to path for hadoop folder we created after uncompressing and moving to location you wanted)" 
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin

ctrl+x and enter to save it

now close and reopen terminal and type : 
which java

copy the path it shows and type:
cd  path/to/your/hadoop/folder
cd  etc/hadoop
nano hadoop-env.sh

add this line at the bottom of the file
export JAVA_HOME = "path you copied above from {which java} command"

ctrl+x and enter to save it.

now close and reopen terminal and type:
hadoop

it should show hadoop commands available and that is how you have hadoop installed for a single node non distributed system.
